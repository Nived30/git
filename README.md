## Challenges

### 1. Calculator Form

Implement a server-side program to create a calculator form, validate two input fields, and calculate the result according to the button pressed.

### 2. Custom Calculator Form

Create a custom calculator form with a specified design, validate given input fields, and calculate the result based on the button pressed.

### 3. Tax Calculator

Design a form to calculate tax based on specific conditions, such as marital status, annual income, and gender, with appropriate tax rates and discounts.

### 4. Registration Form

Develop a server-side script to design a registration form and validate user input using proper format and validation techniques.

### 5. User Registration Page

Build a simple web page that prompts users for name, email, password, phone, gender, and faculty, validates the input, and stores it into a database.

### 6. Login Process

Write a server-side script for the login process, assuming that user data is already stored from a previous registration process.

### 7. Session Management

Implement server-side scripts to store, retrieve, and destroy session data for user authentication and management.

### 8. Cookie Management

Develop server-side scripts to store, retrieve, and destroy cookie data for maintaining user sessions and preferences.

### 9. Authentication Process

Create a complete authentication process, including registration, login, dashboard access, session and cookie storage, and logout functionalities.

### 10. Book Data Storage

Write server-side scripts to store books data with the specified columns in a database table.

### 11. Book Data Retrieval

Implement server-side scripts to retrieve books data stored from the previous challenge.

### 12. Book Data Modification

Develop server-side scripts to modify books data stored from the previous challenge, allowing updates to existing records or addition of new books.

### 13. Book Data Removal

Write server-side scripts to remove books data stored from the previous challenge, providing functionalities to delete specific records or clear the entire database table.
